This repository is my personal workspace for **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)**, offered by Harvard University. The course introduces Python programming and fundamental computer science concepts.

I’m currently learning Python and using this repository to track my progress, solve exercises, and work on small projects.

## 📝 About

CS50P is designed for beginners in programming. Through this course, I am learning:

* ✅ How to write Python scripts and functions
* ✅ How to use conditionals and loops
* ✅ How to handle errors and exceptions
* ✅ How to use libraries to extend Python functionality
* ✅ How to test code with unit tests

This repository contains my **current progress**, exercises, and practice problems from each lecture.

## 🎯 My Goals

* Complete all CS50P lectures and problem sets
* Build small Python projects to apply what I learn
* Gain confidence in Python programming fundamentals
* Prepare for more advanced courses and real-world projects

## 💻 Installation

To try the scripts locally, make sure Python (3.10+) is installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnrslm3/CS50P-Harvard.git
cd CS50P-Harvard
```

Then run Python scripts directly:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```
